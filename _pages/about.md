This website highlights my academic work including my current thesis research project during my master's program at George Mason University. I graduated from West Virginia University with a Bachelors in Biology in the Spring of 2020 and started at GMU the following Fall. My project focuses on developing my plant identification skills that I will need to achieve my career goals of becoming an herbarium curator. 


A Floristic Checklist of Shenandoah River State Park Warren Co., VA

The Park
---
Opening in 1999, SHSP encompasses 1619 acres in the northern Shenandoah Valley of Warren County, Virginia and is located between the Massanutten Mountains and Shenandoah National Park in the Ridge and Valley physiographic province. The park is a conglomeration of ten properties that were purchased by the Commonwealth of Virginia through a 1992, $95 million bond referendum taargeted to expand parks and open spaces for Virginia residents. <a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/shenandoah-river" target="_blank">Park Website</a> 

Rationale

1. **Presence of Rare Ecosystem Types**
  
    _Shale Barren Ecosystems_
    
      A series of unique conditions occurring simultaneously has resulted in the creation of the endemic Appalachian Shale Barren Ecosystems. As the river eroded away the early Appalachian Mountains, weather-resistant shale and sandstone were exposed. On south to west facing slopes where the angle is greater than 30 degrees, these exposed fragments created 'heat islands' where conditions are too harsh for the local vegetation to successfully colonize. Today, vegetation cover is visibly 50% less on these shale barren slopes comapred to the north/east slopes of the same mountain. Over time, plants adapted to these uniquely challenging conditions. ABout 20 endemic or near-endemic species are known from Appalachian shale barren ecosystems.
      
    _Montane Depression Wetland_
    
      Montane depression wetland ecosystems, spread throughout the Ridge and Valley and Blue Ridge provinces, have pronounced seasonal water-level flucturations due to depressional weathering. Shenandoah River State Park contains a small (0.121 ha) montane depression wetland exosystem located between the Tulip Poplar Trail and the Big Oak Trail.
    
2. **Warren County Historically Undercollected**
 
   Of the five northern Shenandoah Valley counties, Warren County ranks last in total herbarium specimens collected (n=2063). However, Waren County (**Figure 1**) ranks similarly to the other counties when looking at the number of unique taxa (n = 1172 spp. and subspp.) and the total number of collections, scaled for area (**Figure 2**). Even with these similar collection data, there are about 212 plant species that have not been colelcted in Warren County but are present in all the surrounding counties. It is likely that these species are prsent, but have not yet been documented due to the relatively sparse collection history of the county.

3. **A Complete Checklist has yet to be done for SHSP**
