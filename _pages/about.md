This website highlights my academic work including my current thesis research project during my master's program at George Mason University. I graduated from West Virginia University with a Bachelors in Biology in the Spring of 2020 and started at GMU the following Fall. My project focuses on developing my plant identification skills that I will need to achieve my career goals of becoming an herbarium curator.
