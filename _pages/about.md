This website highlights my academic work including my current thesis research project during my master's program at George Mason University. I graduated from West Virginia University with a Bachelors in Biology in the Spring of 2020 and started at GMU the following Fall. My project focuses on developing my plant identification skills that I will need to achieve my career goals of becoming an herbarium curator.

The Park
---
Opening in 1999, SHSP encompasses 1619 acres in the northern Shenandoah Valley of Warren County, Virginia and is located between the Massanutten Mountains and Shenandoah National Park in the Ridge and Valley physiographic province. <a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/shenandoah-river" target="_blank">Park Website</a>

Rationale

1. **Presents of Rare Ecosystem Types**

2. **Warren County Historically Undercollected**
 
   Of the five northern Shenandoah Valley counties, Warren County ranks last in total herbarium specimens collected (n=2063). However, Waren County (**Figure 1**) ranks similarly to the other counties when looking at the number of unique taxa (n = 1172 spp. and subspp.) and the total number of collections, scaled for area (**Figure 2**). Even with these similar collection data, there are about 212 plant species that have not been colelcted in Warren County but are present in all the surrounding counties. It is likely that these species are prsent, but have not yet been documented due to the relatively sparse collection history of the county.

3. **A Complete Checklist has yet to be done for SHSP**
